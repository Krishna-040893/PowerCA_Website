## Technical Implementation Details

### Styling Approach
```scss
// Glassmorphism effect (reusable)
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}

// Bento grid responsive layout
.bento-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  
  @media (min-width: 1024px) {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```

### Animation Patterns
```tsx
// Scroll-triggered animation (AnimatedSection)
const fadeInUpVariants = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20, scale: 0.98 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0, scale: 1 },
  transition: { duration: 0.8, ease: [0.33, 1, 0.68, 1] }
}

// Hover interactions
const hoverScale = {
  whileHover: { scale: 1.02 },
  transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading:** Implement for below-fold sections
2. **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component
3. **Animation Performance:** Use transform/opacity only
4. **Bundle Size:** Tree-shake unused template components
